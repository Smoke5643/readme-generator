  ## Description of project
  
  This application was created to help users create their own README files in Markdown format quickly and efficiently. With the help of Node.js, a user can answer a series of prompts in the terminal and those responses will automagically be placed in the designated spots in the README for them. This README can then be used for their own projects upploded to GitHub.
  
  ## Installation
  
  Once you have installed all necessary programs, clone this GitHub Repo to your computer. Open the folder in VS Code and pull up the terminal. Run npm init -y followed by npm i inquirer@8.2.4. Then you can run node index.js and answer the prompts to create your README.
